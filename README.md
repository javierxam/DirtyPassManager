DirtyPassManager
================
This is my first GitHub project, it's a try to help friends to manage passwords with all the simplcity as i can.

The main idea is to create a panel with butons, each buton have a label that describe what password is stored with that buton, when you click on a buton the associated password will be copied into the clipboard, ready for paste.

The idea isn't to create a secure vault for passwords, but a simple md5 encriptation and a master password is in the TODO.

Long moons and good hunt
